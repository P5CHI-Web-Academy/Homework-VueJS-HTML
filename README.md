* Create a layout based on this mockup.

* Dimensions, fonts and colors are up to you.
* For text use simple 'span' (no links or buttons are required)
* Use both Flex and Grid in appropriate places.
* The layout should be fully responsive, should look good on all devices (from mobile to desktop). This means you will have to reorder elements to fit the screen and keep readability.
* Any animations, transitions and other creativity are welcome (but not required)
* Using preprocessors is a big plus (but not required)
